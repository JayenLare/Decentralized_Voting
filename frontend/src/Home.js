        The Heisman trophy is the most prestigious award in college football,
        and it is given to the best player in college football each year. The award is voted on by members of the media, 
        previous winners and fans. The current voting method has many flaws due to its centralized nature. 
        This platform allows the heisman trophy voting process to be completely decentralized by using blockchain technology.
        Decentralization of the voting process removes the need to trust a centralized third-party to determine the correct winner. 
        This improves overall security, transparency and trust in the Heisman trophy voting process.
